Creating a website with the capability to examine and solve question papers from images or PDFs involves multiple components and steps. Here's a high-level breakdown in points:

Backend Development:

Choose a backend framework (e.g., Django, Flask, Node.js).
Implement an API endpoint to receive image or PDF uploads.
Image/PDF Processing:

Use a library like Tesseract OCR for extracting text from images/PDFs.
For PDFs, consider a library like PyPDF2 or pdf2image to extract text.
Text Analysis:

Implement natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and extract questions and answers.
Solving Mechanism:

Develop algorithms or integrate existing ones to solve different types of questions.
Consider using external APIs or libraries for specific problem-solving tasks.
Frontend Development:

Choose a frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
Create a user-friendly interface for uploading question papers.
User Authentication:

Implement a secure authentication system to control access.
Database Integration:

Use a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store user data and processed questions.
Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected scenarios.
Scalability and Performance:

Optimize code and use caching mechanisms for better performance.
Plan for scalability if the user base grows.
Testing:

Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests and integration tests.
Deployment:

Choose a hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for deployment.
Ensure proper security measures.
Remember, developing such a system requires careful planning, expertise in web development, and potentially collaboration with experts in NLP and AI depending on the complexity of the questions. Feel free to ask for more details on any specific point.
